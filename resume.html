        <h3>Projects</h3><hr>
        <h4>Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Restructured a project on detecting the Spam SMS using machine learning and deep learning techniques.</li>
            <li>Cleaned and analyzed the dataset using NLP and visualization techniques such as WorldCLoud in this case.</li>
            <li>Split the data into training set and testing set. And created a LSTM model to train it with the training set.</li>
            <li>Checked the model accuracy for both train and test set. The training set had ~99.9% accuracy and the testing test had ~97.2%.</li>
            <li>Reviewed the Classification report and visualized the confusion matrix using heatmap.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Violence Detection in real time videos</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Investigated the dataset that contains videos that are classified as violence and non-violence. Firstly, visualized the data to get insights what’s happening.</li>
            <li>Extracted the frames from the video using Python’s OpenCV library. And I have created the dataset as a list and checked whether the length of the extracted frames is equal to the sequence length.</li>
            <li>Used OneHotEncoding to convert the labeled data into vectors. And I have split the data into Train(90%) set and Test(10%) set.</li>
            <li>Used a finely tuned MobileNetV2, to build the training model.</li>
            <li>Model accuracy was ~92%. No unusuality in confusion matrix.</li>
            <li>The accuracy sustained at 92% while generating classification report.</li>
            <li>Did a prediction in two ways, frame by frame and on whole video.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cohort Analysis and Modeling in online retail</h4>

            <li>Performed Cohort Analysis to find the retention rate and for average sales quantity.</li>
            <li>Retention rate increased from 2010 to 2011 (45.3% to 45.7%).</li>
            <li>Visualized how sales amount changed with time.</li>
            <li>Took a new online retail dataset and I again did clean and processed the data.</li>
